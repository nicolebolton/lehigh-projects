# Final Project

## MangoDB- find the perfect recipe for you!
# Functionality:
Users can provide a list of ingredients and then receive recipes that use those ingredients. Users

meals a day, but now wants to impress his friends with his limited pantry.
# Architecture:
Users have a username, password, profile image, and a list of favorite recipes, stored in MongoDB
# Libraries/Frameworks:
SemanticUI, https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition/endpoints
https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs , jQuery, bCrypt 
# Team:
